## Emerald Breeding Notes
* Illumise + Any compatible parent = 50% of either Volbeat or Illumise. "Species" should be set to whichever you want
* Volbeat + Ditto = 50% of either Volbeat or Illumise. "Species" should be set to whichever you want
* Nidoran♀ + Any compatible parent = 50% of either Nidoran♂ or Nidoran♀. "Species" should be set to whichever you want
* Nidoran♂/Nidorino/Nidoking + Ditto = Nidoran♂ only. "Species" should be set to Nidoran♂ OR Nidoran♀. Each will give different frames but both will give Nidoran♂. Ignore the gender column
